## Moonshot Vaccine Design Projects
Some things that would improve automated vaccine design, that we either could do given enough resources, or that at least won't definitely fail

### T-Cell Binding Predictions
One of the main immune pathways targeted by vaccines is pathogenic protein -> peptides -> MHC peptide complex -> TCR binding

We have pretty good prediction tools for the second step (e.g. NetMHC). There are some tools that try to predict the last step, but none of them are very good.

Part of the problem is that, because of VDJ recombination, we don't know what T-cell receptors will actually be present in any particular individual.

But it seems likely to me that there *will* be a useful distribution over what kinds of TCRs will be present in a population.
