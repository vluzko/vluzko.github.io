# Concretization: Conditional Expectation
In modern probability theory, we don't define conditional probability with the usual
$$
P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
$$
formula.

Instead we use a much more abstract formulation where we condition on an entire $\sigma$-field. This is much more general but also very far from the basic definition, and it's really quite hard to find a good exposition of how we recover usual conditional probability from conditional expectation.

## Conditioning on a \(\sigma\)-field
We want the conditional expectation to satisfy the following property:
\[
    \int_G E[X | \mathcal{G}] dP = \int_G X dP
\]

## Conditional probability on a \(\sigma\) - field
The conditional probability of an event \(A\) on a \(\sigma\)-field $F$ is the conditional expectation of its indicator variable:
$$
P(A| F) = E[1_A | F]
$$


## Conditioning on an event
Okay, back to the beginning. If we want to condition on an event $B$, we just condition on the \(\sigma\)-algebra generated by \(B, B^c\)
