# Concretization: Conditional Expectation
In modern probability theory, we don't define conditional probability with the usual
$$
P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
$$
formula.

Instead we use a much more abstract formulation where we condition on an entire $\sigma$-field

## Conditioning on a \(sigma\)-field

The conditional expectation of an event \(A\) on a \(\sigma\)-field $F$ is:
$$
