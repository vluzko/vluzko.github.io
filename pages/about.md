## About

I'm a PhD student studying machine learning at McGill. My research is focused on causality, RL, and safety. I'm also working on some related statistical learning theory problems.

Before grad school I worked at Moderna on automated vaccine design for their cancer vaccine project ([mRNA-4157](https://www.modernatx.com/pipeline/therapeutic-areas/mrna-personalized-cancer-vaccines-and-immuno-oncology)), and as an ML engineer on some more general problems. I'm still interested in and occasionally consult on the intersection of biology and ML.
